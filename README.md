## User Story
```
AS A person who works out frequently
I WANT to be able to log my daily excercises 
SO THAT I can keep track of the weight, set, reps and duration of exercise
```

## Business Context

## How Fitness Tracker Works
Fitness Tracker allows users to keep track of their workout by tracking the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. Using mongoose, a model was created to allow the user to input their exercise information into the database and load once they click complete workout. The user is able to continue the workout and add more exercises, or start a new workout which provides them with a clean slate and generates new stats for them.
